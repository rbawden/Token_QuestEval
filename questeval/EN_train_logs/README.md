Note that this log file is from when we didn't debug perplexity scoring function, so ignore the perplexity-related scores (pred score & gold score)

I have 700 randomly such log file randomly sampled from when I computed the correlation score over all SummEval dataset. So the training set for the weighter is a randomly sampled subset of SummEval.
